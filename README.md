MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX designed to be powerful and easy to use.

Main website is https://moc.daper.net/, this software is created and maintained by its authors who can be contacted by [this support page] (https://moc.daper.net/node/269)

Here I spread the specification files (moc.spec) which can be used to build RPMs binary packages of MOC, according to the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines] (http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines).

This repository will remain activated until new RPM Fusion infrastructure is completed.
